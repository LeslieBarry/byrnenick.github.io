<p>Some of the most profound impacts technology is it's ability to remove unnecessary middlemen from the economy.</p>

<p>The music industry used to be built around the production and distribution of vinyl, tapes, and CDs. Now any creator can publish their work for free on Youtub and reach millions of people instantaneously.</p>

<p>Banks in 2019 distribute and manage a product of central banks: Fiat currency. Blockchain offers the ability for the rules  of a currency to be expressed as code, and then have people exchange directly ('peer-to-peer'), making obsolete any bank or payments provider who is acting purely as a distributor.</p>

<p>Unsophisticated middlemen businesses are a dying breed.</p>

<p>New business opportunities will emerge in their place. People still want to browse, search, and discover music; and Spotify and iTunes are growing rapidly as a result. Similarly, people will still need assistance with our daily financial lives, as technology advances we should anticipate a similar shift in offerings to become available.</p>

<p>Technology eventually standardises and modularises digital assets to the point that an intermediary can no longer yield an unreasonable amount of power in the value chain of the industry. What takes their place is usually much more innovative, and customer centric offerings. Ones that are more convenient, and offer more value than what preceeded it.</p>
