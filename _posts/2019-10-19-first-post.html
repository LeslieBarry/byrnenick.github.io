<p>Every year for three years I set myself a goal of running an ultramarathon. Each year I set the ultramrathon goal I laid out a training plan and went to work only for injury or other set backs to interrupt the plan. Eventually I gave up on the goal before revisiting it the following year.</p>

<p>Shifting my attention away from the goal and well defined training plan, and toward creating daily habits for myself changed everything and in 2017 I ran my first ultramarathon. The daily habit I created was to run everyday, a minimum of 1 mile. That's it. After 6 months of doing this, I was ready to finish an ultramarathon - not in record time - but make it in one piece across the finish line.</p>

<p>This experience highlighted to me the power of focusing on daily habits when trying to achieve a goal.</p>

<p>My current goal is to become a better technology and innovation communicator. And while I have tried other techniques to improve this before, much like the marathon running, nothing stuck. So I hope to now create a daily habit of blogging here.</p>

<p>The practice of daily habits is one reinforced by the books <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299">Atomic Habits</a>, and more specifically the act of daily blogging is very encouraged by <a href="https://seths.blogging">Seth Godin</a>.</p>

<p>From his blog <a href="https://seths.blog/2015/02/say-something/">Ruckusmaker Day:</a></p>

<blockquote>"Committing to having a point of view and scheduling a time and place to say something is almost certainly going to improve your thinking, your attitude and your trajectory.
A daily blog is one way to achieve this. Not spouting an opinion or retweeting the click of the day. Instead, outlining what you believe and explaining why.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Commit to articulating your point of view on one relevant issue, one news story, one personnel issue. Every day. Online or off, doesn't matter. Share your taste and your perspective with someone who needs to hear it.
Speak up. Not just tomorrow, but every day.
A worthwhile habit."</blockquote>
