<p>What are the market dynamics of innovation? How does technological change shape industries, and how are winners and loosers selected within industries?</p>

<p>I have been reflecting on questions like this, mostly because of how provacative blockchain has been. There are the evangelists and there are those in staunch opposition of this technology, often ridiculing it as a fad. I think the reason for this division in views about the technology arise from a lack of understanding about the dynamics of technological change. Of how technology, or digitisation more specifically, enters and radically changes an industry.</p>

<p>The forces acting on an industry and organisation has been well studied. Put very simply, there are two main forces: external forces acting on an industry, and competitive forces within an industry. One of the most popular frameworks expanding on this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter%27s_five_forces_analysis">Porter's Five Forces Framework</a>, a model taught in business schools and adopted by management consulants around the world.</p>

<p>There are a lot of forces influencing industries, but the most dominant force driving change today arises from advancing technologies. Understanding how technological change is acting on an industry therefore becomes incredibly important when evaluating innovation threats and opportunities. Similarly, technology is changing the competitive dynamics of industries. Incumbants often dismissing startups before being later disrupted, or startups often underestimating the power of the incumbant.</p>

<p>I have found it interesting to study and reflect this concept of external and internal forces of change facing industry's so that I can better understand the context and hence threats and opportunities presented by technology, especially blockchain. The most interesting concepts I have found so far are <a href="https://singularityhub.com/2016/11/22/the-6-ds-of-tech-disruption-a-guide-to-the-digital-economy/">The 6 Ds of Tech Disruption</a> for understanding external (technological) forces facing an industry, and Clayton Christensen's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Whats-Next-Theories-Innovation/dp/1591391857">Seeing What's Next</a> for understanding the competitive dynamics shaping industries from within.</p>

<p>I hope to write and reflect more about these forces in future articles.</p>
