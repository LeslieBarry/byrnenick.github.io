<p>Digital technologies lower market barriers to entry, making it easier for new entrants to offer products and services. Whenever I am short of innovation inspiration, I look for intermediaries in the economy and reflect upon how technology may, one day, make them redundant and what the consequences of that may mean.</p>

<p>One example of this is how the internet reduced the cost to distribute media (text, audio, video etc) to effectively zero. Pretty much anyone on the the planet can now create content and have it online and available for anyone else in the world at zero cost. Before the internet the distirbution of media was controlled by a handful of powerful organisations, intermediaries made redundant through our technological progress.</p>

<p>Coming back to 2019, if I were to ask you "who holds a significant amount of power in an industry, and perhaps looks like the music industry did in 1995?" what organisation or industry would come to mind?</p>

<p>For me, banks are the first thing that come to mind, and specifically commercial banks.</p>

<p>While it is our central banks who set the rules that govern our monetary system, it is the commercial banks manage the distribution of money: It is the network of commercial banks who enable you to send money to someone, and ensure your account balance is as it should be.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology reduces the distribution cost of money to effectively zero, undermining the value the commercial banks offer today. So what happens to the banking sector once distribution costs go to zero? Can regulatory measures realistically offer a barrier to entry to new players, protecting the established banks?</p>

<p>History suggests that it won't be the established banks who bring about the new paradigm, it will be new entrants to the sector: be they startups, or other organisations moving laterally into banking and finance. May be "this time is different".</p>

<p>Ignoring the seriousness of this for too long will have ramifications beyond just commercial banking as blockchain offers extensibility and convenience the current fiat system cannot match. Ignore for too long and sovereign currrencies may find themselves at risk too, competing against the extensibility and conveniences of new global crypto and digital currencies.</p>

<p>The stage is being set. Facebook plans to launch a digital currency (Libra) to their 2.4b users in 2020, China is close to launching their digital currency, and there is a growing list of other initiatives signalling that, just over 10 years after Satoshi gave us bitcoin, we're at the beginning of another potentially profound shift.</p>
