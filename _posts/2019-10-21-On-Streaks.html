<p>Seth Godin's blog on streaks is a great reminder about why creating daily habits are much more powerful than setting large goals and commitments. Our daily habits are what shapes our future, as these are what we use to pursue our commitments (whether consciously or not).</p>

<p>I have found it relatively easy to gather momentum and buidling streaks when it comes to health and exercise. Running, eating well, not drinking alcohol. But when it has come to writing, I have struggled: I often find it difficult to break big ideas down into smaller ones that I can use to create momentum. So creating a habit of reflection and writing, I hope, will force a focusing of ideas and reflections. This focus will lead to more concise writing and communication, and overcoming the challenge of working through large ideas and concepts.</p>

<p>And truth be told, today's meta reflection on the act of writing daily is because my current grander idea, on the diffusion of innovations, is too big to fit into a daily reflection!</p>

<p>Building momentum is important. From Seth Godin again...</p>

<blockquote>Streaks are their own reward.<br>
Streaks create internal pressure that keeps streaks going.<br>
Streaks require commitment at first, but then the commitment turns into a practice, and the practice into a habit.<br>
Habits are much easier to maintain than commitments.<br>
