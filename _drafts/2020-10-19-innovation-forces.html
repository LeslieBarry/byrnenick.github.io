<p>Innovation teams have become very competent at surfacing and communicating customer insights and their unmet needs ('desirability'); along with experimenting with new technologies ('feasibility'). But I'm yet to come across a consistent approach to evaluating the market, and addressing the question surrounding an ideas 'viability'.</p>

<p>This is important for those working in large organisations and startups because your ability to communicate assumptions around viability will determine your likelihood of sustaining short-term stakeholder support (and funding). More significantly, your assumptions around viability dictates your focus: it informs the market opportunity you see emerging, which in-turn prioritises your customers, your competitors, and how you develop your value proposition and product.</p>

<p>What would happen if we considered viability first? Before investing too much in customer research, or technological feasibility?</p>

<p>This is a question I've been reflecting on lately, and Clayton Christensen's book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Whats-Next-Theories-Innovation/dp/1591391857">Seeing What's Next</a> has influenced my thinking a great deal. As has Peter Diamandis' "6 Ds of Exponentials".</p>

<p>
	The 6Ds of Exponentials provides a high-level overview of how digitisation changes the nature of industries. It's claim is that eventually all industries becomes digitised. And at this point it becomes and exponential technology and moves through 6 phases of (1) digitisataion, (2) deceptive, (3) disruptive, (4) demonetized, (5) dematerialised, and (6) democratized.
</p>

<p>
	If we take this model to be true, recognising what stage of technological disruption your industry is experiencing is a significant input into your innovation investment decisions. The early stages of digitisation will present differrent commercial opportunities to that latter stages, where democratisation and commodisation are more dominant. 
</p>

<p>
	Reflecting on the banking and payments industry as of October 2019, we might be observing the final stages of the digitisation of money - 'democratisation' going by the 6Ds framework. The start of this process commenced when banks started using computers for record keeping, entered a disruptive phase with internet banking and Paypal, and approaches the democratisation phase with the introduction of blockchain as a standard for the distribution money. 
</p>

<p>
	An individual of firm who does not recognise this process, may still be investing in mobile apps and proprietary digital relationships with their customers. Denying users ability to access their banking service from outside of the banks own web or mobile application, and only innovating within this proprietary domain. On the other hand, an organisation who recognises this trend would be at least investing in APIs that allows the customer to access their banking service from within other digital applications. But in reality, we're very early in the democratisation phase of the digitisation of money - so it's not yet clear how this will play out!
</p>

<p>
	The digitisation and eventual democratisation of the music industry went from selling CD's in physical retail stores, to streaming, subscription based platforms of Spotify and iTunes. The outcome of this shift is that consumption of media has gone up dramatically, and the business models of media companies have had to shift radically with it. Banks and others working in the financial services industry should be predicting a similarly radical shift in consumer expectations, and the resulting business model needed to support these expectations. The risk and opportunity the financial services sector has that the music industry didn't is high regulatory barriers to entry.  It is a risk because these regulatory barriers can breed a culture of complacency, but it is an opportunity if used correctly to lean into this technological shift and become a market leader in the resulting new paradigm.
</p>


<p>
	In summary, I think it's interesting to consider the 6Ds as a model for understanding the forces of technological change facing an industry and take steps towards better understanding the viability of an innovation investment opportunity.
